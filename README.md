# Facebook-For-Android-Wear

Intro:
Facebook For Android Wear is a basic unofficial Facebook client for your Android Wear powered Smartwatch.
This app is a work in progress and is missing many essential features. Current features include:
Feed - browse your feed only. No pagination. View Likes and Comments (up to 25) for each post.
Photos - browse albums and photos for each album (only 20ish photos per album. No pagination)
Status - voice input status upload. Demo only - does not actually post a status.

Many of these features are limited based on the strict API limits of the Facebook SDK.

Getting Started:
This app requires a bit of work to get setup properly.
Clone the repository.
You will also need to create a Facebook developer account and input your key hash.
There is a button in the mobile app to help you do this.
Copy your facebook app id to the strings.xml file in the Shared module.
Install the Mobile module to your phone.
Log into the application on your phone. If you do not see your profile picture, try exiting and reopening the app.
Install the Wear module on your watch.
Enjoy!
